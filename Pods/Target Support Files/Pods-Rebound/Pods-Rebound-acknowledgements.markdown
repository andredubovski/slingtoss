You hereby agree that if you do not want the Operator and/or its designated Personal Data processing contractor to collect, process, store and/or use any of your Personal Data, you may not or will not be able to use certain functionality of the AdToApp Platform, order Services via the AdToApp Platform, or use those sections or modules of the AdToApp Platform that require or may require your Personal Data in accordance with their designated purpose.

##PERSONAL DATA OF CHILDREN AND TEENS

The AdToApp Platform is intended for use by adults only. The Operator and its designated Personal Data processing contractor (if applicable) do not knowingly collect, process, store, use or disclose Personal Data of children younger than 13 years of age and teens aged between 13 and 18 years of age.

If the Operator has learned or has sufficient grounds to believe that Personal Data is submitted by a child or a teen instead of an adult, the Operator reserves the right to suspend the personal profile through which the Personal Data was submitted and request provision of an e-mail address of the parent or legal guardian of the submitting person so that the Operator can notify the parent or legal guardian that their child or teen has provided Personal Data through the AdToApp Platform and provide an opportunity for the parent or legal guardian to request the deletion of that Personal Data from the relevant records. The Operator will contact the parent or legal guardian at the e-mail address provided and the parent or legal guardian will have 48 hours from delivery of the e-mail to advise who exactly submitted the Personal Data. If the parent or legal guardian fails to reply to the query sent to the provided e-mail address, the Operator will assume that the parent or legal guardian has not consented to collection and processing of their child’s or teen’s Personal Data, after which the related personal profile will be immediately terminated and the Personal Data in question will be purged from Operator’s and/or its designated Personal Data processing contractor’s records.
